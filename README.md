# EmberDB

## Overview
**EmberDB** is a minimalist database built from scratch to explore essential database concepts like persistence, indexing, and concurrency.

## Features
- **Persistence**: Data storage mechanisms ensuring data is saved and recoverable across sessions.
- **Indexing**: Implemented indexing for efficient data retrieval.
- **Concurrency**: Basic mechanisms to handle multiple requests, ensuring data consistency.

## Requirements
To run EmberDB, youâ€™ll need:
- Python (or another preferred programming language)
- Basic knowledge of data structures (arrays, hash tables, B-trees)
- Optional: Docker (for containerized deployment)

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ember-db.git
    cd ember-db
    ```
2. **Install dependencies** (if required).

3. **Run EmberDB**:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Project Structure
- **main.py** - Main file to start the database.
- **persistence/** - Handles data storage, writing, and retrieval.
- **indexing/** - Manages indexing structures like B-trees and hash tables.
- **concurrency/** - Includes concurrency control and basic transaction management.
- **tests/** - Unit tests for each database component.
